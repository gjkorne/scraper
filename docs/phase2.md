# Phase 2: Resume Parsing & Management - Progress Report

**Last Updated:** April 13, 2025  
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress  
**Target Completion:** June 15, 2025

## Overview

Phase 2 focuses on building a comprehensive resume management system that integrates with the job scraping functionality developed in Phase 1. The system allows users to upload, parse, manage, and version their resumes, with the goal of creating tailored versions for specific job applications.

## Current Progress

We've made significant progress in Phase 2, having completed several key components:

### 1. âœ… Database Schema
- Implemented tables for `resumes`, `resume_versions`, `resume_sections`, `job_resumes`, and `resume_job_matches`
- Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- Created migration scripts for PostgreSQL

### 2. âœ… Resume Upload System
- Built `ResumeUpload` component with drag-and-drop functionality
- Implemented file validation for type and size
- Added upload progress tracking with cancellation option
- Integrated with Supabase Storage

### 3. âœ… Resume Parsing Service
- Created Edge Function for extracting structured data from resume files
- Implemented section detection and content categorization
- Added support for multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)

### 4. âœ… Version Control System
- Implemented versioning with tracking of current and historical versions
- Built UI for comparing different resume versions
- Added metadata tracking for each version

### 5. âœ… Resume-Job Matching
- Developed algorithm for matching resumes against job descriptions
- Implemented keyword and skill extraction and matching
- Created scoring system for compatibility assessment
- Added recommendation engine for resume improvements

## Immediate Next Steps

Here's where we left off and how to proceed:

### 1. Test and Deploy the Resume-Job Matching System

#### Current Status:
- Edge Function (`match-resume-job`) has been created
- Database table (`resume_job_matches`) has been added to the schema
- Frontend component (`ResumeJobMatcher`) has been implemented
- Test page has been added to the app

#### Testing Steps:
1. Deploy the Edge Function to Supabase:
   ```bash
   cd supabase/functions
   supabase functions deploy match-resume-job --project-ref <your-project-ref>
   ```

2. Test the function using the UI:
   - Navigate to the "Resume Match Test" page in the app
   - Select a resume and a job from the dropdowns
   - Click "Match Resume to Job"
   - Verify that the match results are displayed correctly

3. Verify data storage:
   - Check that match results are saved in the `resume_job_matches` table
   - Confirm that subsequent visits show the cached results

### 2. Implement Resume Comparison Feature

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Create a `ResumeCompare` component that:
   - Allows selection of two resume versions
   - Shows side-by-side comparison
   - Highlights differences between versions

2. Add UI for tracking which resume version was sent to which job

3. Testing Steps for Resume Comparison:
   - Create multiple versions of a resume
   - Compare versions and verify differences are highlighted
   - Check history tracking for which version was sent to which job

### 3. Add Resume Templates System

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Create predefined resume templates
2. Implement a template selection UI
3. Add functionality to apply a template to resume content

4. Testing Steps for Templates:
   - Verify templates render correctly
   - Test applying different templates to the same content
   - Ensure templates are responsive and print correctly

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components
- `ResumeManager.tsx`: Main component for managing resumes
- `ResumeUpload.tsx`: Handles file uploads
- `ResumeJobMatcher.tsx`: Matches resumes to jobs
- `ResumeCompare.tsx` (to be implemented): Compare resume versions

### Backend Services
- `parse-resume`: Edge Function for extracting data from resume files
- `match-resume-job`: Edge Function for matching resumes to jobs

### Database
- `resumes`: Stores resume metadata
- `resume_versions`: Tracks different versions of each resume
- `resume_sections`: Stores sections of parsed resumes
- `resume_job_matches`: Stores matching results between resumes and jobs

## Testing Approach

### For each component:

1. **Resume Upload Testing**
   - Upload various file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
   - Test size limits and validation
   - Verify progress tracking
   - Check storage in Supabase

2. **Resume Parsing Testing**
   - Verify section detection for different resume styles
   - Check accuracy of content extraction
   - Test handling of various formatting

3. **Resume-Job Matching Testing**
   - Test with various resume and job combinations
   - Verify score accuracy against manual assessment
   - Check recommendation relevance
   - Test performance with large documents

4. **Version Control Testing**
   - Create multiple versions of resumes
   - Verify correct tracking of current version
   - Test history navigation

## Current Challenges

1. **Parsing Accuracy**: Different resume formats and structures present challenges for consistent parsing.
2. **Matching Algorithm Tuning**: Need to fine-tune keyword weighting and importance factors.
3. **UI/UX Refinement**: Need to improve the user experience for complex workflows.

## How to Resume Development

If you're returning to this project after some time, follow these steps to quickly get back up to speed:

1. **Review the codebase**:
   - `src/components/ResumeManager.tsx`
   - `src/components/ResumeUpload.tsx`
   - `src/components/ResumeJobMatcher.tsx`
   - `supabase/functions/match-resume-job/index.ts`

2. **Check for TypeScript errors**:
   - Run `npm run typescript:check` to find any type issues

3. **Deploy the Edge Function**:
   - Use the command above to deploy the resume matching function

4. **Test the existing functionality**:
   - Navigate to the Resume Match Test page
   - Try matching a resume to a job

5. **Start working on the next feature**:
   - Implement the Resume Comparison feature
   - Or enhance the Resume-Job Matching UI

By following this guide, you should be able to continue development exactly where we left off, completing the remaining items for Phase 2 and preparing for Phase 3 (Resume Customization).
