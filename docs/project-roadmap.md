## Prioritization Framework

When deciding which features to prioritize within phases, use the following criteria:

1. **Impact Score (1-5)**: How much value will this provide to users?
2. **Effort Score (1-5)**: How much development time will this require?
3. **Risk Score (1-5)**: How likely is implementation to encounter issues?
4. **Priority Score = Impact Ã· (Effort Ã— Risk)**

Features with the highest priority scores should be implemented first within each phase.

## Feedback Collection System

For each major feature area, we will collect feedback through:

- [ ] In-app feedback forms after key actions
- [ ] User interviews (5 users per phase)
- [ ] A/B testing of alternative implementations
- [ ] Analytics on feature usage and time spent
- [ ] Satisfaction surveys

Feedback will be documented and used to guide refinements in each phase.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| API rate limits on job sites | High | High | Implement sophisticated retries, proxies, and caching |
| Complex resume formats | Medium | Medium | Support common formats first, add specialized parsers gradually |
| AI API costs | Medium | Low | Implement usage limits and optimize prompt engineering |
| User adoption | High | Medium | Conduct user research and iterate on feedback |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Regular security audits and following best practices |
| Performance issues with large data | Medium | Medium | Implement pagination, lazy loading, and optimize queries |

## Resources & Dependencies

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Supabase, Edge Functions
- External APIs: Consideration for OpenAI or similar
